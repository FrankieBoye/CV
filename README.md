##### Frankie Bamgboye

I am a former I.T. desktop support engineer and data collection analyst. Data collection involved collating and delivering digitally held evidence. This background has given me a wealth of experience working in technical teams and liaising with a wide range of colleagues.
Having always been curious about what goes on in the background, I decided to learn to code with Makers Academy. I want to be able to design and make things happen, and make solutions or even improve existing architecture with like-minded individuals. I chose Makers as they are Europe’s leading developer boot camp and they have the best reviews.

#### Skills
##### Communication
Working in support roles, good communication was absolutely essential. I had to be able to listen and disseminate the relevant information from end users for I.T. issues and legal, litigation, compliance and investigation teams for data collection. This helped me develop the ability to communicate well with both non-technical and highly technical members of staff.
##### Problem solving
In I.T. support you could face a huge amount of widely varied issues day to day so it was absolutely essential to have a methodical approach to solving issues. I have found this skill invaluable in coding which is similar in that it is impossible to know every syntax and being able to find a solution quickly and efficiently is paramount.

##### Experience
